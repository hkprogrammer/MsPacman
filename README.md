## Policies
Trained policy network objects
### MsPacManPG_1.pt & MsPacManPG_2.pt
> Created during development of improved policy  
> Not final versions of policy
### MsPacManPG_optimized.pt
> Final version of policy trained on 10000 episodes
## Replay
Gameplay renderings of different trained policies
### MsPacMan_beforeOptimizing_replay.mp4
> Gameplay of policy network from Hugging Face 
> Deep Reinforcement Learning course with minimal changes
> and 10000 episodes of training
### MsPacMan_replay_0.mp4, MsPacMan_replay_1.mp4, MsPacMan_replay_2.mp4
> Created during development of improved policy  
> Not gameplay from final versions of policy
### MsPacMan_replay_3_best.mp4 & MsPacMan_replay_3_worst.mp4
> Best and worst gameplay of final trained policy over 1000 episodes
## Scores
Scores of each episode during training sessions
### scores_afterOptimizing.csv
> Training of final version of policy network over 10000 episodes
### scores_beforeOptimizing.csv
> Training of initial version of policy network from 
> Hugging Face Deep Reinforcement Learning course with minimal changes
